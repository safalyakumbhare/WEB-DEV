    <h1 class="italic">Italic Font</h1>
    <p class="italic">
      Italic font is a distinct style of typeface that is visually slanted to
      the right. It originated during the Italian Renaissance in the 15th
      century and has since become widely used in typography. The slanted design
      of italic fonts adds a touch of elegance, emphasizing specific words or
      phrases within a text. Italic fonts are commonly employed for emphasis,
      titles and headings, foreign words, citations and references, and in
      creative writing and poetry. However, it is important to use italic font
      sparingly and purposefully to avoid readability issues or diminishing the
      impact of emphasized words. In digital typography, italic fonts are
      readily available and can be easily applied using word processing
      software, graphic design programs, or HTML/CSS coding.

    <h1 class="Cursive">Cursive Font</h1>
    <p class="Cursive">
      Cursive font, also known as script or handwriting font, is a typeface that
      mimics the flowing, connected strokes of handwriting. It is characterized
      by its continuous and often looped letterforms, resembling the style of
      cursive handwriting taught in schools. Cursive fonts aim to replicate the
      natural movement of a writing instrument, such as a pen or a brush.

    <h1 class="dance">Dancing Script</h1>
    <p class="dance">
      Dancing Script is a casual script font designed by Pablo Impallari and
      Igino Marini. It is a lively and bouncy font that references popular
      scripts typefaces from the 1950s. The letters in Dancing Script are
      slightly irregular in size and weight, which gives the font a more organic
      and handwritten feel. The caps are large and go below the baseline, which
      adds to the font's informal and playful character.
